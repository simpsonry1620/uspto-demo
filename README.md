# Smart Document Retrieval

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of transformer models to embed text data into numerical representations for calculating similarity scores with query strings. It leverages the `SentenceTransformer` library to perform semantic search on patent abstracts from the USPTO dataset.

## Installation
If using NVIDIA AI Workbench, simply clone the repo and launch the example notebook.

## Usage
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Embed the dataset using a pre-trained transformer model.
Perform semantic search to find similar documents based on a query string

## Features
Data Embedding: Converts text data into numerical embeddings using transformer models.
Semantic Search: Retrieves documents semantically similar to a given query.
Visualization: Plots similarity scores for analysis.
